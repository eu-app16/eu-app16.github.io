# Erasmus Plus Eu-App16 project
This project, which is possible thanks to Europen Comission, who generously paid for it, has a simple goal - to make our students' future lifes better, by letting them learn things which are essential in today's world. Be it a good skill communicating in English, management of human resources, programming or use of the computer. Other than that, we also hope, that our student's work will have results - they shall make wonderful and helpful apps, that will solve different kinds of real life problems, which will also help their respective communities, bringing joy not only to themselves, but also to others.
Namely we teach them Android and Arduino programming among other things.

## Site
Our site is a modified version of mdl templates, with adhoc solutions, maybe ain't pretty but they work for now.
