This week was the week in which first official meeting in this project took place. Students from all across the EU came to Eisenberg, Germany, to learn, work and have fun together.


It all began on Sunday, when all the teams from: Poland, Italy, Czech Republic and Englang have joined their collegues from Germany.

After a quick rest day, they began their week that'll be full of work and also rich in opportunities to learn both from each other and from some excellent experts.

Let's hope, that they'll use it fully and gain a lot from this meeting setting a fitting example for teams from other meetings.
