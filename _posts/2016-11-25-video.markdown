Today we'd like to present you a video made by the students taking part in the meeting in Eisenberg. Everything was done entirely by them - they did all the photographing, photo shooting, editing and so on, with a slight guidance from their teachers.

It was a good experiance for them, as they could all learn from eachother and learn how to work in groups, which is a very important skill these times.

Without further ado, here you go!
