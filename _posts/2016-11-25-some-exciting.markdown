Lorem ipsum
Our day started at  8.30  in the computer room.
We worked on our projects and went for lunch at „Jahnstube“ after that.
We first had the idea for the app, but the projects will be ended in the other countrys .
We liked working with the students from other countrys and loved the harmony  in our group.

Friday, 25.11.16
Today we had to present what our groups have done in the last few days.
After the presentation we drove to Mainz and enjoyed the sightseeing .
It's a big city with lots of interesting sights, remarkable  landmarks, fantastic food and had a lot of fun there. The trip was very tiring so we all went to sleep early.
